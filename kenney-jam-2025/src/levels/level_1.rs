/*
 * TODO
 * Still need to figure out how exactly to realize this
 * The basic idea is that one level = one file, and all level logic is handled in it's associated file
 * -> should make it easy to add more levels later
 *
 * Note: using XML- or JSON-files do define levels and loading them at runtime to generate levels in a generic fashion would be more flexible and properly make it faster and easier to add new levels, but that method would also be more prone to errors
