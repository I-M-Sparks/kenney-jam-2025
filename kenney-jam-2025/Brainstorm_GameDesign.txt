Game concept: 
-Goal: break down all Blocks in sight
-mechanic: ball gets faster over time -> deals more damage to blocks, but is also mopre difficult to keep above ground
-move slider with mouse (left/right only)
-base concept: speed = power; power is needed top clear the board

optional ideas:
-clicking will charge the slider for a short while; bouncing the ball while charged will increase the speed more (or similar)
-collectable speed/power boosts
